      <h1>Matter</h1>
      <p>Matter is a cloud storage product focused on improving collaboration through extensive note and chat features. This project was part of a eight-month mentorship completed in 2019. Over a period of 4 weeks, I researched, designed, and determined the brand identity for my Bloc Designer Track project.</p>

  <!-- PROBLEM & SOLUTION -->
  <section class="probsol">
    <div class="problem">
      <h4>PROBLEM</h4>
      <p>Given the versatile uses for cloud storage products, I found in my preliminary research (discussed in-depth below) that uses fit into three, very broad, categories: professional, school, and personal. What was common among each of these three that users were not just using these products for storage, but also to collaborate to meet deadlines and goals. With that, I further found that there was room for improvement in the collaboration tools within cloud storage products. <p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution">
        <h4>SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>A suite of features focused on increasing collaboration between users. Through comprehensive user research, I found that users were interested in incorporating chat and note sharing features, as well as a feature that would allow them to save content directly from the web. As such, Matter was designed with these user needs in mind. </p>

      <p class="comp-one">I first performed a competitive analysis of three major competitors (Dropbox, Google Drive, and Evernote), and identified an opportunity for a hybrid document management and note taking product, which  offers the best of both types of products. </p>
      <p class="comp-two">Through analysis of the common strengths of these products, I identified standard features that users are used to seeing in their current cloud storage product. I decided that priority was for these features to work seemlessly in Matter, and then to include the desired collaboration features identified within the user survey and interviews.</p>

    <p class="persona-quote">"Chatting with collaborators would be helpful to keep our teams on track"</p>

    <p class="persona-findings">Further interviews with user participants to establish these personas brought another desirable feature to light-- the ability to chat within shared folders (in addition to shared documents). This would allow collaborators of shared folders to chat within them to reduce redundancy and miscommunication. Following these interviews, I identified an opportunity to improve collaboration, and decided to steer the product in that direction.</p>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3 class="conc-title">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="conc-one">One of the biggest lessons from this project was the importance of putting aside my ego and trusting the research. While designing the visual design, I lost confidence in my product, as I felt that it was not innovative enough. However, my research told me that users were looking for better collaboration features, and the users needs take priority over mine. </p>
      <p class="conc-two">I learned the next lesson after the high-fidelity usability tests were performed, and realized that the issues identified were very similar to those identified in the wireframe usability tests. In the high-fidelity usability tests, participants had a hard time creating new notes, while in the wireframe usability tests, participants had a hard time creating new files. I realized that my questions in the first wireframe usability tests were not as specific as they could have been, and that this issue could have been identified much earlier had I asked the right questions earlier, but luckily the questions in the second round of testing were much more detailed and this issue was eventually identified.</p>
