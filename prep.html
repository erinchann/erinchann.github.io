  <!-- PROBLEM & SOLUTION -->
  <section class="probsol">
      <h4 class="prob-title">PROBLEM</h4>
      <p class="prob-copy">The average American household throws out 25% of the food they purchase, and a family of four throws out more than $1,600 a year in wasted food. These statistics alone show that there is a widespread food waste problem across the country. In my preliminary research, I found that users have a strong interest in reducing their food waste. <p>
      <h4 class="sol-title">SOLUTION</h4>
      <p class="sol-copy">A suite of features that provide more visibility over food inventory and waste. These features include the ability to see when their food will expire and how to use it before it does, to create custom grocery list to prevent over buying, and to track food waste period over period. </p>

        <p class="comp-copy">The first thing I did was perform a competitive analysis of three competitors, in order to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. Most notable are the stregnths outlined below.</p>

      <div class="survey-one">
        <h8>The problem redefined</h8>
        <p>From user surveys, users identified two root issues as the cause of their food waste:</p>

          <li>1. Forgetting about groceries due disorganization</li>

      <div class="survey-two">
        <h8>Possible solutions</h8>
        <p>I also found that users were felt the following solutions would actually help solve their food waste:</p>

          <li>1. The ability to search recipes for food on hand (to help use it up)</li>
          <li>2. Alerts to let them know that foods going bad, and how to use them up</li>

From the mind map exercise, I liked two names, Savor and Prep. I ended up going with Prep because this application is meant to help users prepare before buying groceries, meal prep, and prepare to minimize waste. Check, check, check!

However, the brand colors needed to emulate the brand, and while I enjoyed the pink and orange, the colors felt too feminine, and could potentially deter male users.

First and foremost, I wanted to make sure that the typefaces were very clean and easily readable--without ornate type features. This was mostly for usability purposes, since users could view recipes with long text within the application.<br>The Prep brand typeface is Rubik, a sans serif font with slight rounded corners. This typeface was chosen because of its modern, clean, and clear nature.<br>The complementary typeface is Karla, a grotesque sans serif typeface. This typeface was selected since it is sophisticated and clear, and the letter width and spacing also gives it a slight playful feel. It also pairs well with the Rubik brand typeface.</p>

I asked users about their buying patterns, how often their grocery receipts included items that would not be used in their own homes (i.e., purchasing food for the office or for parties). The users tested responded that most of the time, their receipts matched the food that would actually go into their kitchens. As such, the receipt items were all selected by default.</p>

          <h8>Add new pantry button position</h8>
          <p>I was curious about whether the “add” button on the pantry screen should be lower, and more accessible for the user since it will most likely be a frequently used button on the screen. Responses were mixed, some liked that they would be able to select the “add pantry” button with just one hand. Others didn’t think it mattered since they might need two hands to complete the process (depending on which process they use). Given this feedback, I moved the button lower in order to make the beginning of the process to add a new item easier. </p> <br>
          <p>Furthermore, one user was clicking around the product, she made an insightful comment regarding the pantry list-- missing filter and sort options. I thought these would be a great addition since it would allow users to view their pantry items by expiration date or alphabetical order--both equally useful.</p>

            <h8>Contextual overlays</h8>
            <p>In order for users to mark pantry items as eaten, edit pantry items, or delete pantry items, the user has to swipe the pantry item to the left. I wasn’t sure if users would be able to perform this without proper context. I then decided to use contextual overlays, in hopes that it would be enough. Usability test participants agreed, and this was implemented across various different screens (home page, grocery list, and recipe book). </p>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <section class="conclusion">
      <h4 class="conc-title">Conclusion</h4>
      <p class="conc-one">Prep is a project that I am passionate about. There were so many things I was uncertain of in the early stages, and saw the true power of user testing. I was confident in the decisions that I made because I performed user testing to test my assumptions. This project was a humbling experience--it taught me to accept that I don’t know everything about users, and it would be foolish of me to assume that I do.</p>
      <p class="conc-two">In considering the further development of the current minimal viable product, I would like to implement functions that would allow better organization of pantry items into different sections. I would also like to consider partnerships with grocery stores to either offer coupons or to share user data with grocery stores, so they can also understand buyers' consumption habits to optimize food product servings or offerings. From a revenue perspective, these could become viable revenue streams through affiliate commission. I believe that these goals can be achieved through user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. </p>
