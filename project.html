      <h1>Matter</h1>
      <p>Matter is a cloud storage product focused on improving collaboration through extensive note and chat features. This project was part of a eight-month mentorship completed in 2019. Over a period of 4 weeks, I researched, designed, and determined the brand identity for my Bloc Designer Track project.</p>

  <!-- PROBLEM & SOLUTION -->
  <section class="probsol">
    <div class="problem">
      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>Given the versatile uses for cloud storage products, I found in my preliminary research (discussed in-depth below) that uses fit into three, very broad, categories: professional, school, and personal. What was common among each of these three that users were not just using these products for storage, but also to collaborate to meet deadlines and goals. With that, I further found that there was room for improvement in the collaboration tools within cloud storage products. <p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>A suite of features focused on increasing collaboration between users. Through comprehensive user research, I found that users were interested in incorporating chat and note sharing features, as well as a feature that would allow them to save content directly from the web. As such, Matter was designed with these user needs in mind. </p>
      </div>

    <!-- RESEARCH -->

      <h3>Research</h3>
    </div>
    <!-- COMP ANALYSIS -->
    <section class="comp-analysis">
      <h4 class="title">Competitive analysis</h4>
      <p class="comp-one">I first performed a competitive analysis of three major competitors (Dropbox, Google Drive, and Evernote), and identified an opportunity for a hybrid document management and note taking product, which  offers the best of both types of products. </p>
      <p class="comp-two">Through analysis of the common strengths of these products, I identified standard features that users are used to seeing in their current cloud storage product. I decided that priority was for these features to work seemlessly in Matter, and then to include the desired collaboration features identified within the user survey and interviews.</p>
    </section>
    <!-- SURVEYS -->
    <section class="surveys">
      <h4 class="title">Surveys</h4>
      <div class="survey-one">
        <h5>86%</h5>
        <p>of participants were interested in a feature to save content directly from the web in a cloud storage product.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="survey-two">
        <h5>50%</h5>
        <p>of participants were interested in a note-taking feature in a cloud storage product.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="survey-three">
        <h5>Insights</h5>
        <p>The key takeaway from the survey was the analysis of pain points and features, which showed me that users were interested features that would drive collaboration. </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <!-- PERSONAS -->
    <section class="personas">
      <h4 class="title">Personas</h4>
      <p class="summary">Personas for this project represented a variety of roles, and were created based on interviews to understand their motivations, frustrations, and goals. </p>
      <div class="persona-one">
      <div class="persona-avatar">
        <img src="assets/persona-matthew.png" alt="image of matthew persona one">

    </div>
    <p class="persona-name">JULIA</p>
    <p class="persona-quote">"Chatting with collaborators would be helpful to keep our teams on track"</p>
    </div>
    <p class="persona-findings">Further interviews with user participants to establish these personas brought another desirable feature to light-- the ability to chat within shared folders (in addition to shared documents). This would allow collaborators of shared folders to chat within them to reduce redundancy and miscommunication. Following these interviews, I identified an opportunity to improve collaboration, and decided to steer the product in that direction.</p>

        <p class="flow-summary">Following user personas, I identified important tasks and user stories for the cloud storage product. These user stories were then converted into user flows in Figma, to illustrate how the user would accomplush these tasks most effectively.</p>

      <p class="wf-finding">Overall, the participants had positive responses to Matter and were able to navigate the site smoothly, with the exception of one issue-- all participants had a hard time adding a new file. All participants were looking for this option on the homepage, but instead they had to first click into the “File” page. Since adding a new file is a high priority task, I fixed this problem by adding a “Create new file” button on the home page.</p>

        <p class="mindmap">The users that were interviewed all had busy student and professional lives, all with the intention to slow down once business was handled. This brought me to the tagline “Focus on what matters”. From there, I performed a mind mapping exercise, which helped me narrow down to “Matter”.</p>

        <p>Once the brand name was determined, I played around with different logo variations. First I sketched logos, playing with different “M” designs. From these sketches, I further developed three sketches into digital logos.</p>

        <img src="assets/color-swatches.png" alt="brand color swatches">
        <p>I used a purple color as the brand color as it represents trust and creativity. Since I am including a feature where users can directly save web content to the application, one of the main uses will be to draw inspiration from the web. This brings an element of creativity into the experience. </p>
        <p>I went with an analogous color scheme of blue, violet, and red based colors. The blue further emphasizes trust, while the red based colors offer a welcome complement to the purple used throughout the application. </p>

    <!-- TYPOGRAPHY -->
    <section class="type">
      <h4>Typography</h4>
      <p>For this project, the style choices made were done so in order to emulate brand trust, professionalism, and creativity. First and foremost, I knew I wanted sans-serif typefaces to create a modern look. I went with Oxygen as the brand typeface, and Source Sans Pro for the supplementary typeface. I found that these two typefaces had the right balance of professionalism and flare, without being outdated.</p>
      <div class="brand-typeface"
      <p class="typeface-name">Oxygen</p>

        <p class="test-result">73% of participants preferred the option on the right, as it was more apparent that the “share” and “more” components were buttons.

        <h6>High fidelity mockup - Second iteration</h6>
        <p class="use-finding">All participants of the prototype usability tests took longer to create a new note as opposed to creating any other content type. This signalled to me that the “Create new note” feature should also be included on the home page, as note taking and sharing features are important for collaboration, and thus important for the users. I did not catch this challenge in the first wireframe usability test as I did not specify at the time for participants to create all content types, and since I emphasized that in the high fidelity mockup usability test, this challenege was identified at this time. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding-two">
        <p class="use-finding">Furthermore, one participant of the usability test had a hard time understanding the “note” content type. When she was asked to create a new note, she tried to select the “more” option on a document to add a comment. Since one other participant from the first wireframe usability test had the same issue, I decided to include this information on the landing page to introduce this content type.</p>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>One of my biggest lessons from this project was the importance of putting aside my ego and trusting the research. While designing the visual design, I lost confidence in my product, as I felt that it was not innovative enough from other products already on the market. However, my research told me that users were looking for better collaboration features, and the users needs take priority over mine. </p>
      <p>Another takeaway was the necessity of talking to user research participants, live. I found that conversations with these participants unveiled pain points that they had either ignored and accepted as unchangeable, or pain points that thye never realized they had. These findings would not have been possible had our discussions been limited to surveys and online conversations. </p>
